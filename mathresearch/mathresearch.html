    <div class = "rightbox">  So you made it to my math research page, yay! Throughout my time as an undergraduate I have had some incredible opportunities to conduct math research. </div>

    <div class = "rightbox"> In the summer of 2014, I particiated in a pure math REU that was based out of CSU Fresno. During the REU I did graph theory research which was focused on the Well-Covered Dimension of Levi Graphs. Together with another undergraduate student Jessica Hauschild who was participating in the REU and our research advisor Professor Vega we created and proved a theorem concerning the Well-Covered Dimension of Point-line Configurations. After we proved this theorem, we got the opportunity to present a <a href="./REU_Poster.pdf"> poster </a> at the Undergraduate poster session at the 2015 JMM/MAA joint mathematics conference that was held in San Antonio. During the summer we also produced a <a href= "./REU_Paper.pdf"> paper</a> on our theorem that has now been published in the mathematics journal, Involve - a journal of mathematics in Vol. 8(2015), No. 5, 893-900. I would put a link to the publication itself but the journal requires a subscription so the pdf of my paper will have to suffice. Along with being able to say that I now have a publication I am also able to say that I have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős_number"> erdos number<a/> of less than or equal to 4 which I am also very pleased about.</a></div>

    <div class = "rightbox"> During the 2014/2015 school year with the guidance of my thesis advisor Professor Omar, I completed my <a href="./thesis.pdf"> Senior Thesis</a>. My thesis was on graph theory and focused on orbital chromatic polynomials. I also got the opportunity to present a <a href="./thesis_poster.pdf"> poster </a> at the 2015 Pacific Coast Undergraduate Mathematics Conference poster session. </div>
