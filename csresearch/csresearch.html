      In the summer of 2015 I was given a wonderful opportunity to do cs research at Harvey Mudd. I worked closely with 2 other Harvey Mudd students under the guidance of Professor Kuenning. Throughout the summer we investigated algorithms to rearrange blocks of memory on disk in order to significantly decrease overall seek distance. We investigated algorithms that would significantly decrease overall seek distance in the hopes that this would decrease the amount of time that disk I/O took overall. We belive that a significant decrease in overall seek distance will speed up disk I/O since one of the main sources of delay in disk I/O is seek time. Throughout the summer we spent time researching algorithms that would decrease overall disk I/O which used techniques from sequence mining, clustering algorithms and greedy approaches, we also spent time developing data structres in c++ to begin to test the quality of our algorithms.

      There were only very preliminary results that needed to be tested more thoroughly as is the result in many short term research opportunities. One of my larger contributions to this project was developing data structures in c++ to test the algorithms we developed. The code that I worked on can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/jazmin-ortiz" target = "_blank"> github account </a>. My group has also presented <a href="./cs_poster_abstract.pdf"> poster abstract </a> on our findings to the 2015 SOSP Undergraduate Poster Session.</div>
