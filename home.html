        Hello! My name is Jazmin and this is my website. Currently my website is a sad website, that I slapped together to have a nice email when I applied to software engineering jobs right out of college. I've decided I want to update this website to learn a little React and some modern UI framework(probably <a href="https://mui.com/core/" target="_blank">MUI</a>) so it may be somewhat broken at times while I update.

    <div class = "rightbox">
         So I did end up getting that software engineering job I wanted! I'm a software engineer at Salesforce...I'm I guess you would call a "full stack" engineer, on the front end I work in both <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/intro_components.htm" target="_blank">Aura</a> and <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc" target="_blank">LWC</a>, these are Salesforce specific UI frameworks, I also use Java to write controllers and data providers and even get to dabble in designing new entities for the database.
